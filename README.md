### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my repos

👨‍🎓 I'm a Master's student at the University of Michigan, specializing in Mechanical Engineering and Robotics. My primary interests lie in the fascinating fields of robot perception and motion planning.

#### A little about me:

- 🔭 **Currently Working On:** I am deeply immersed in projects that focus on enhancing the capabilities of robots through advanced perception and intelligent motion planning algorithms. My goal is to contribute to the development of more intuitive and efficient robotic systems.
  
- 👯 **Looking to Collaborate:** I am open to collaborations, especially on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics. Whether it's developing software for autonomous systems or researching new methods of robot-environment interaction, I'm here for it!

- 🤔 **Seeking Help With:** I am always looking for guidance and advice from experienced professionals in the field of robotics and AI. If you have insights or want to share your experiences, I'd be thrilled to learn from you.
  
- 📫 **How to Reach Me:** The best way to get in touch with me is through my email: junhaotu@umich.edu.

- 😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him

- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** When I'm not delving into the world of robots, I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. There's nothing quite like finding parallels between the natural world and the mechanical systems I study!
